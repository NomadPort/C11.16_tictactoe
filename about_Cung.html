    My name is Cung Tran, and I am Asian. I have been living in U.S for 5 years.I enjoy the simple things in life. Being happy is a state of mind, and I don't think people should settle for less than they deserve. I always look toward the next best thing. I have graduated in Finance at CSU FULLERTON. After graduating I finally worked at bank where I always wanted to work during my school years. During my working experience at bank and other financial institution i realized "fiance major" was not what i really wanted to do and it was definitely not making me happy. I met my wife and we both opened online business where I succeed creating a website. And that was when i found my calling about coding. I decided to join Learningfuze after 4 weeks self-taught at home.

    I want to work as  back end developer because I love manipulating data. Computing and computer technology are part of just about everything that touches our lives from the cars we drive, to the movies we watch, to the ways businesses and governments deal with us. Understanding different dimensions of computing is part of the necessary skill set for an educated person in the 21st century. Coding is such a perfect good fit for my skills and personalities. Moreover, the job offer good salary and sometime with flexible schedule too.
