                <h2 class="underline"> About Me </h2>
                <h3> background </h3>
                <p> I have a BS degree in aerospace engineering and my career consists of 16 years working in that industry (Lockheed Martin and Boeing).  I was laid off in 2011 and the past 5 years I have been a stay-at-home dad for three small kids while my wife works.  As part of my college education, I learned programming languages (FORTRAN, Pascal) and got exposed to others (C, C++, HTML) while working.  After graduating, I programmed via FORTRAN an orbital mechanics program that was used by my professor's students.
                </p>
                <h3> why i'm taking this class </h3>
                <p> Initially, I wanted to get back into the aerospace industry the past year, but it has been tough as the industry has not ramped up as I had hoped.  Of all the alternatives, becoming a web developer seemed the most prudent.  There seems to be a need for them, the pay isn't bad, and I liked programming in school.  I like the challenge of solving a problem through math, logic and utilizing the computer's resources (doing operations very fast and doing things repetitively without complaining).  I never programmed professionally and I imagine that there are differences between the programming languages I took in the past and current web development languages.  I don't want to spend alot of time getting another bachelor's degree, so it seems a bootcamp is the right course.  After checking a couple different bootcamps, LearningFuze seems to be the right fit.
                </p>
                <h3> the job i want </h3>
                <p> I think the first job I want is a front-end web developer.  I want to know the design principles, rules of thumb, etc. that go into creating a well-designed website and I want to practice them.  After that, I'm not sure as it would be presumptuous of me to know all the different specialties within web development.  As an end goal, I would become a master and my reputation would allow to select which projects to work on both at work and on my own.
                </p>
                <h3> why i'm hungry for that job </h3>
                <p> Starting out, I want to point to some website and say "That's my creation or I worked on that part of it."  That'll be great motivation, especially in the beginning.  Also, I need to start working so that my kids know that I can and will work.
                </p>
